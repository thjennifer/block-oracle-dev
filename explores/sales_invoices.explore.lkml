# PURPOSE
# Retrieve information about sales invoices, including both
# header-level attributes and line-item details.
#
# SOURCES
# see include: statements
#
# REFERENCED BY
#   LookML dashboards:
#     otc_billing_and_invoicing
#     otc_billing_invoice_line_details
#
# CATEGORY SET NAME
#   - This Explore will show only 1 Category Set Name based on the value in the user attribute
#     cortex_oracle_ebs_category_set_name.
#       * Users can set the value for the user attribute through Account properties. Or an Admin can set the value for a group of users.
#   - This filter condition is defined in two spots:
#     1. the JOIN properties for optional view sales_invoices__lines__item_categories
#     2. in the view sales_invoices__lines for the category_description, category_id and category_name_group dimensions
#
# LANGUAGE
#   - This Explore will show only 1 Language for item descriptions based on the value in
#     parameter parameter_language.
#       * Users can change the parameter value in the provided LookML dashboards or Explore.
#       * In the provided LookML dashboards the, the default value for this parameter is based on the value in
#         the user attribute cortex_oracle_ebs_default_language.
#   - This filter condition is defined in two spots:
#    1. the JOIN properties for optional view sales_invoices__lines__item_descriptions
#    2. in the view sales_invoices__lines for the item_description and language_code dimensions
#
# OTHER NOTES
#   - The view definitions for sales_invoices and sales_invoices__lines include a subset of the available fields.
#     To include/exclude additional fields in the Explore, refer to the view definitions and
#     adjust a field's hidden property.
#
#   - Item descriptions and categories are defined in sales_invoices__lines so the unnested
#     views do not need to be included in the Explore. However, you can optionally include by
#     uncommenting the join statements below.
