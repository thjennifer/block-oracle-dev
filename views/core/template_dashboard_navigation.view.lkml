# PURPOSE
# Provides a template for dynamically creating and formatting HTML links for
# navigation between dashboards including the transfer of filter values.
#
# SOURCE
# none (This template can only be EXTENDED into another view)
#
# STYLES
# This template provides three styles for the html links. Pick which one to use
# with parameter_navigation_style
#   1. buttons
#          parameter label: "Buttons"
#          parameter value: "buttons"
#   2. tabbed
#          parameter label: "Tabs"
#          parameter value: "tabs"
#   3. plan hyperlink
#          parameter label: "Plain Hyperlinks"
#          parameter value:  "plain"
#
# To add or modify styles, edit or add related Constants in the Manifest file
#
# FILTERS
# This template allows a dasboard to pass up to 20 possible filters. The dimensions are
# named filter1 to filter20 and hidden by default.
# Modify this template to add more filter dimensions as needed.
#
#
# STEPS TO EXTEND THIS TEMPLATE {
# When extending this template, make the REQUIRED customizations by following these steps:
# 1. Create new view
# 2. Add "extend: template_dashboard_navigation" property (use name of this view)
# 3. Edit dimension map_filter_numbers_to_dashboard_filter_names.
#     - Update the "sql" property with the mapping of filter numbers to dashboard filter names.
#     - For each filter that needs to be passed between dashboards, assign a generic filter number 1 to N.
#     - This can be a broad list of filters that do not need to appear on every dashboard but should appear on at least 2 dashboards.
#     - Filters unique to a single dashboard do not need to be included here (as values do not pass to other dashboards).
#     - Use | between number and dashboard filter name
#     - Use || between each filter
#     - Note if dashboard filter name contains a space use + to represent the space (e.g. Order Date should be entered as Order+Date)
#     - You will specifiy the specific set of filters used in a dashboard in the dimension dash_bindings
#     - An example for 4 dashboard filters:
#           sql: '1|date||2|business_unit||3|customer_type||4|customer_country' ;;
#
# 4. Edit dash_bindings dimension
#    - Update the "sql" property with ID, Link Text and Filter Set of each dashboard:
#       ID - For UDD dashboards use numeric id. For LookML dashboards use dashboard name with or without model name.
#           131
#           model_name::dashboard_name1
#           dashboard_name1
#
#       Link Text (e.g., Sales Performance)
#
#       Filter Set used on the given dashboard. Use numbers 1 to N as specified separated by comma (e.g., 1,2 or 1,3,4).
#         Use numbers as specified in dimension map_filter_numbers_to_dashboard_filter_names
#
#     - Use | between each dashboard property.
#     - Use || between each dashboard set.
#     - Examples:
#       sql: '131|Dashboard 1 Link Text|1,2||132|Dashboard 2 Link Text|1,2,3,4' ;;
#       sql: 'dashboard_name1|Dashboard 1|1,2||dashboard_name2|Dashboard 2|1,2,3,4';;
#       sql: 'model_name::dashboard_name1|Dashboard 1|1,2||model_name::dashboard_name2|Dashboard 2|1,2,3,4';;
#
# 5. Update parameter_tab_focus with any extra values needed to match the number of dashboards.
#    Note, when extending, allowed values are additive, so only add values beyond 2.
#
# 6. Edit filter1 to filterN (up to 20) dimensions to set the type, unhide and/or label.
#    Make sure filter dimension's type matches the field it is mapped to. For example, if filter1 is linked to a date field,
#    change the type to date. The filter dimensions are string by default.
#    Note if only using in LookML dashboards, the filter dimensions can remain hidden.
#
#}
#
# USING IN A DASHBOARD {
# 1. Once the extending view has been created and modified, add to an Explore using a bare join:
#       explore: sales_orders {
#           join: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext {
#           view_label: "ðŸ›  Dashboard Navigation"
#           relationship: one_to_one
#           sql:  ;;
#       }
#       }
# 2. Open the Explore and add "Dashboard Links" dimension to a Single Value Visualization
# 3. Add the navigation parameters to visualization and set to desired values
#           Navigation Style = "Buttons"
#           Navigation Focus Page = 1 for Dashboard 1. Set to 2 for Dashboard 2 and so on
# 4. Add navigation filters to the visualization. These filters will "listen" to the dashboard filters.
# 5. Add Visualization to dashboard and edit dashboard to pass the dashboard filters
#    to Filters 1 to N accordingly.
#
#    Alternatively, you can edit the dashboard LookML and the "listen" property as shown in
#    the LookML example below:
#       - name: navigation
#         explore: sales_orders
#         type: single_value
#         fields: [otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.navigation_links]
#         filters:
#           otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.parameter_navigation_focus_page: '1'
#           otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.parameter_navigation_style: 'buttons'
#         show_single_value_title: false
#         show_comparison: false
#         listen:
#           date: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter1
#           business_unit: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter2
#           customer_type: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter3
#           customer_country: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter4
#           customer_name: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter5
#           target_currency: otc_dashboard_navigation_ext.filter6
