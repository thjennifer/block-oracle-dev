#########################################################{
# PURPOSE
# based on user inputs for bucket size and number of buckets,
# create a table dynamically with fields:
#   aging_bucket_number
#   aging_bucket_name
#   start_days
#   end_days
#
# SOURCES
#   none
#
# REFERENCED BY
#   Explore sales_payments
#
# NOTES
# - join to Explore sales_payments using:
#       sales_payments.days_overdue BETWEEN start_days and end_days
# - A "Current" bucket will always be generated in addition to the # of Ranges the user specifies.
#   For instance, if the aging bucket size is 30 days and the number of ranges is 3, 4 buckets will
#   be created. The first bucket will be called
#   '30 Days Past Due' and will include invoices that are between 1 and 30 days old. The following bucket will be called
#   '60 Days Past Due' and will include invoices that are between 31 and 60 days old. And the third bucket will be called
#   '61+ Days Past Due' and will include invoices greater than or equal to 61 days old.
#   A 'Current' bucket where age is <=0 days will be added.
